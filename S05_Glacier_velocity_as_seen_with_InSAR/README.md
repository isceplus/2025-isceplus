# Glacier Velocity Mapping with InSAR
2021 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Paul Rosen, David Bekaert, Heresh Fattahi, Gareth Funning, Franz Meyer, Brent Minchew, Hilarie Davis, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Shubham Awasthi, Faizan Sabir, Luyen Bui, Pratyusha Gonnuru, Becca Bussard

ISCE Version: v2.5.2

MintPy Version: v1.3.1

Resources: Module resources

Expected Outcome: Understand the basic processes of glacier flow and how they influence InSAR observations, including the components of velocity, primary features of glacier flow observable in InSAR, and common sources of decorrelation. Discuss some common approaches to measuring glacier flow velocity using SAR and their relationship to other available methods. 

Assessment: Execute the self-directed notebook, inspect the result, and respond to the prompts
